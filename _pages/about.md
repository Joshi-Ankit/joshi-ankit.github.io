I am a Research Scientist in the [School for Engineering of Matter, Transport & Energy at Arizona State University](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/). My research encompasses two primary domains: (i) Modeling heat and mass transfer from the human body in extreme environments (heat/cold), including human thermoregulation models, and (ii) Investigating the influence of clothing on heat transfer. These areas collectively aim to enhance our understanding of the thermal comfort and health implications on human body when exposed to various thermal environment.

As Research Scientist, I am working on [Dynamic Sensing and Computational Approaches to Assess Individual-level Heat Risk Across Diverse Populations](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2152468&HistoricalAwards=false). The project aims to develop innovative methods, leveraging a combination of advanced mobile biometeorological stations and human-shaped thermal manikins, to measure human heat exposure in extreme conditions. I am working on  researching and refining models that translate built environment thermal measurements into realistic convective and radiative boundary conditions for computational manikin simulations, and advanced thermoregulatory models addressing critical knowledge gaps in the impact of air turbulence and radiation distribution on diverse body types. I will contribute to the development of novel field methods, and advanced simulation tools emphasizing the application of this research to mitigate health risks associated with extreme heat.
